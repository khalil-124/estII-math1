Because organic molecules can become incredibly complex (some natural products have hundreds of atoms!), chemists have developed elegant shorthand conventions to draw them quickly and clearly. This chapter will teach you to "read and write" organic chemistry fluently.

What you will master:
• The zig-zag notation for carbon chains
• How to interpret skeletal structures like a professional chemist  
• The complete catalog of functional groups
• Clayden's powerful oxidation level system
• Essential trivial names you must memorize

By the end, you'll be able to look at a drug like Ibuprofen and instantly identify all its functional groups!`;

        content: `Before we dive into the rules, let's see WHY skeletal structures are essential.

Palytoxin is one of the most complex and toxic natural products known. It was isolated from a coral in Hawaii. If we tried to draw every atom:
• 129 Carbon atoms
• 223 Hydrogen atoms  
• 54 Oxygen atoms
• 3 Nitrogen atoms

The full structure would be unreadable chaos! But with skeletal notation, even Palytoxin can be drawn clearly on a single page.

THE POWER OF SIMPLIFICATION:
Skeletal structures remove "noise" (the repetitive C's and H's) so you can focus on:
1. The overall shape of the molecule
2. The functional groups (the reactive parts)
3. The stereochemistry (3D arrangement)

Even simple molecules benefit. Compare these for pentane (C₅H₁₂):

Full Structure: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃
Skeletal Structure: A simple zig-zag with 5 corners

        title: "The Three Golden Rules of Skeletal Structures",
        content: `Drawing molecules correctly is the first step to understanding them. Master these three guidelines and you'll draw like a pro.

═══════════════════════════════════════
RULE 1: The Zig-Zag Line
═══════════════════════════════════════

Carbon chains are ALWAYS drawn as zig-zag lines. Why?

Because carbon atoms with single bonds are tetrahedral, with bond angles of approximately 109.5°. A zig-zag line on paper is the best 2D representation of this 3D shape.

Bond Angles by Hybridization:
• sp³ (single bonds) → 109.5° → Zig-zag drawing
• sp² (double bonds) → 120° → Slightly wider angle
• sp (triple bonds) → 180° → Straight line

⚠️ WARNING: Never draw a straight line for an alkane chain!
If you draw a straight carbon chain, chemists will think you mean an alkyne (triple bond), which IS linear (180°).

═══════════════════════════════════════
RULE 2: Omit Carbon Labels
═══════════════════════════════════════

We NEVER write the letter 'C' for carbon atoms. Instead:

• Line end = CH₃ (methyl group)
• Simple corner = CH₂ (methylene)
• Corner with 1 branch = CH (methine)
• Corner with 2+ branches = C (quaternary)

How to count hydrogens: Carbon ALWAYS forms 4 bonds. Count the visible bonds, subtract from 4, and that's how many H's are attached.

Example: A corner with 2 lines = 2 bonds shown → 4 - 2 = 2 hydrogens → CH₂

═══════════════════════════════════════
RULE 3: Omit Hydrogens on Carbon
═══════════════════════════════════════

We do NOT draw hydrogen atoms attached to carbon. They are "invisible" but implied.

❗ THE CRITICAL EXCEPTION:
You MUST write out hydrogens attached to heteroatoms (atoms that are NOT carbon or hydrogen).

✓ Correct: -OH, -NH₂, -SH
✗ Wrong: -O, -N, -S

This is the #1 beginner mistake. If you forget the H on oxygen, you've drawn a completely different (often impossible) molecule!`,

TYPES OF CARBON CHAINS
═══════════════════════════════════════

Saturated vs Unsaturated:

• Alkane: Single bonds only → Saturated → Example: Propane
• Alkene: Contains C=C → Unsaturated → Example: Propene  
• Alkyne: Contains C≡C → Unsaturated → Example: Propyne

"Saturated" means the carbons are bonded to the maximum number of hydrogens possible. Adding a double or triple bond "unsaturates" the molecule (fewer H's).

═══════════════════════════════════════
RING STRUCTURES (CYCLIC COMPOUNDS)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Carbon chains can "bite their own tail" to form rings:

Common Ring Sizes:
• 3-membered (Cyclopropane) → Strained! (60° angles, wants 109°)
• 4-membered (Cyclobutane) → Strained (90° angles)
• 5-membered (Cyclopentane) → Stable (nearly ideal angles)
• 6-membered (Cyclohexane) → Very stable (adopts "chair" shape)

═══════════════════════════════════════
AROMATIC RINGS: BENZENE AND BEYOND
═══════════════════════════════════════

Benzene is special. It's a 6-membered ring with alternating double bonds, but it behaves VERY differently from alkenes.

Key features:
• Completely planar (flat)
• Extra stability from delocalization
• Drawn as a hexagon with a circle inside (or alternating double bonds)
• Does NOT react like typical double bonds

Fused Ring Systems:
Aromatic rings can share edges:
• Naphthalene: Two fused benzene rings (mothball smell)
• Anthracene: Three fused rings in a row
• Pyrene: Four fused rings

═══════════════════════════════════════
STEROIDS: THE ULTIMATE RING SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════

Steroids have a specific 4-ring structure that appears in many important hormones:

Examples:
• Cholesterol (membrane component)
• Testosterone (male hormone)
• Estradiol (female hormone)
• Cortisol (stress hormone)

<h4>🧠 Memory Tips</h4>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>For Aldehydes/Acids:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Form"</strong> = 1 carbon (like "first")</li>
<li><strong>"Acet"</strong> = 2 carbons (like "acetate" in vinegar)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>For Aromatics:</strong> Think of the BASE: <strong>Benzene</strong>
<ul>
<li>Add -OH → <strong>Phenol</strong></li>
<li>Add -NH₂ → <strong>Aniline</strong></li>
<li>Add -CH₃ → <strong>Toluene</strong></li>
</ul>

THE IUPAC SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: Find the Parent Chain
• Identify the longest continuous carbon chain containing the principal functional group
• This determines the base name:
  - 1C = methane, 2C = ethane, 3C = propane, 4C = butane, 5C = pentane...

STEP 2: Number the Chain
• Number from the end that gives the functional group the lowest number
• If there's a tie, give substituents the lowest numbers

STEP 3: Name Substituents
• Identify branches (methyl, ethyl, etc.)
• List them alphabetically before the parent name
• Use prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-) for multiples

STEP 4: Assemble the Name
• Substituents in alphabetical order + position numbers + parent name + suffix

═══════════════════════════════════════
FUNCTIONAL GROUP SUFFIXES
═══════════════════════════════════════

• Alkane → -ane → Example: Propane
• Alkene → -ene → Example: Propene
• Alkyne → -yne → Example: Propyne
• Alcohol → -ol → Example: Propanol
• Aldehyde → -al → Example: Propanal
• Ketone → -one → Example: Propanone
• Carboxylic Acid → -oic acid → Example: Propanoic acid
• Amine → -amine → Example: Propylamine

═══════════════════════════════════════
EXAMPLES WITH POSITIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════

• CH₃-CH₂-OH → Ethanol (2C alcohol)
• CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₃ → Propan-2-ol (OH on carbon 2)
• CH₃-CO-CH₃ → Propan-2-one (C=O on carbon 2)
• CH₃-CHO → Ethanal (aldehyde always at C1)

═══════════════════════════════════════
WHEN TO USE EACH SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════

• Lab notebook, conversation → Trivial names (faster)
• Formal publications, new compounds → IUPAC names (unambiguous)
• Complex natural products → Trivial only (IUPAC too long)

For this course: Know both! Use trivial names for common molecules, IUPAC for everything else.`,

VANILLIN (Vanilla Flavor)
═══════════════════════════════════════

What is it? The main component of vanilla extract.

Functional groups present:
• Aldehyde (-CHO): Gives characteristic smell
• Ether (-OCH₃): A methoxy group on the ring
• Phenol (-OH on benzene ring): Makes it slightly acidic

Structure notes:
• Aromatic ring with three substituents
• The aldehyde is directly on the benzene ring (benzaldehyde derivative)

═══════════════════════════════════════
IBUPROFEN (Pain Reliever)
═══════════════════════════════════════

What is it? A common NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug).

Functional groups present:
• Carboxylic Acid (-COOH): Essential for activity, makes it acidic
• Aromatic Ring: The benzene core
• Alkyl chains: Propyl and isobutyl groups

Structure notes:
• The carboxylic acid is not directly on the ring
• There's a CH₃ branch near the acid (chiral center)

═══════════════════════════════════════
LINALOOL (Lavender Scent)
═══════════════════════════════════════

What is it? A terpene found in lavender and many other plants.

Functional groups present:
• Alcohol (-OH): A tertiary alcohol
• Alkene (C=C): Two double bonds

Structure notes:
• Not aromatic (no benzene ring)
• Acyclic (no rings at all)
• Pleasant floral smell

═══════════════════════════════════════
YOUR CHALLENGE
═══════════════════════════════════════

For any new molecule you encounter:
1. Identify the skeleton: Is it cyclic? Aromatic? Branched?
2. Find heteroatoms: Where are the O, N, S, or halogens?
3. Name the functional groups: What type? (aldehyde, ketone, acid, etc.)
4. Assign oxidation levels: What level is each carbon attached to heteroatoms?

With practice, this becomes automatic!`,

        title: "3D Representation: Wedges and Dashes",
        content: `Molecules are 3D objects, but we draw them on 2D paper. To show depth, we use the wedge and dash convention.

═══════════════════════════════════════
THE CONVENTION
═══════════════════════════════════════

• Solid line ─── In the plane of the paper (flat)
• Solid wedge ▲ ─── Coming OUT towards you (forward)
• Dashed line ╌╌╌ ─── Going IN away from you (backward)

═══════════════════════════════════════
HOW TO READ WEDGE-DASH STRUCTURES
═══════════════════════════════════════

Imagine you're looking at a table:
• Solid lines = bonds lying flat on the table
• Wedges = bonds pointing UP off the table towards your eyes
• Dashes = bonds pointing DOWN through the table away from you

═══════════════════════════════════════
WHY THIS MATTERS
═══════════════════════════════════════

Biochemistry depends on shape!

Consider your hands: Left and right hands have the same components but are mirror images. Many molecules are like this—two versions that are non-superimposable mirror images.

Examples:
• L-Alanine (amino acid our bodies use) vs D-Alanine (not used)
• Thalidomide: One form treats morning sickness, the mirror image causes birth defects!

Enzymes are like locks. Only the correctly shaped molecular "key" fits. If a group is pointing the wrong way (wedge instead of dash), the molecule won't work—or worse, may cause harm.

═══════════════════════════════════════
WHEN TO USE WEDGES AND DASHES
═══════════════════════════════════════

You don't need them for every molecule. Use them when:
1. Stereochemistry matters (Chapter 4+)
2. Showing a specific 3D shape (like tetrahedral carbon)
3. Ring conformations (chair cyclohexane)

For now, just recognize what they mean when you see them. We'll dive deep into stereochemistry later!`,
