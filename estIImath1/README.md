## 14. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 14.1 Cultural Sensitivity
- Use neutral names (no religious/ethnic bias)
- Diverse contexts (not only Western scenarios)
- Universal units (metric preferred, both if needed)
- Avoid culturally specific references

### 14.2 Accessibility
- Clear fonts in diagrams
- High contrast colors
- Avoid relying solely on color coding
- Provide sufficient time per question

### 14.3 Answer Key Format
Q1: [Letter] - [Brief explanation]
Q2: [Letter] - [Brief explanation]
...

### 14.4 Scoring Guidance
- Each question worth 1 point
- Total score: 40 points
- No penalty for wrong answers (encourage educated guessing)
- Percentile interpretation based on difficulty distribution

## 15. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

❌ **Don't**:
- Include topics removed in 2026 specs (3D geometry, logs, etc.)
- Make questions too computational without conceptual depth
- Use ambiguous language
- Create "trick" questions
- Have multiple correct answers
- Use outdated notation

✅ **Do**:
- Align precisely with domain weights
- Balance cognitive levels
- Use clear mathematical language
- Create plausible distractors
- Include context where appropriate
- Test understanding, not just memorization
