Comprehensive Research Report: Assessment Design and Item Development for EST II Math Level 1 – Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability (2026 Specifications)
Executive Summary
The transition to the 2026 specifications for the Electronic Scholastic Test (EST) represents a significant paradigm shift in the assessment of high school mathematics in the MENA region. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability domain within the EST II Math Level 1 examination. Commissioned to guide educators and content developers, this document delineates the architectural changes of the exam, establishes a psychometric framework for item creation, and delivers a vetted bank of 200 practice items designed to mirror the cognitive rigor of the new format.
The 2026 redesign reduces the total item count from 50 to 40 while maintaining a 60-minute duration, effectively increasing the time allocation per item from approximately 72 seconds to 90 seconds.1 This adjustment signals a move away from speededness toward power testing, necessitating questions that require deeper interpretative and reasoning skills rather than mere procedural fluency. For the Data Analysis domain, which commands a weighting of 15%–20% of the exam, this implies a focus on statistical literacy—the ability to interpret data models, assess variability, and apply combinatorial logic—over rote calculation.1
This report confirms the removal of advanced topics such as conditional probability and exponential regression from the Level 1 syllabus, refining the focus to core descriptive statistics, linear regression, and fundamental probability.2 The following sections detail the methodology for constructing valid assessment items, analyze the specific learning outcomes for this domain, and present a comprehensive repository of practice material.
Part I: The 2026 Assessment Architecture and Specification Analysis
1.1 Structural Evolution of the EST II Math Level 1
The 2026 specifications introduce a streamlined test design intended to minimize candidate fatigue and enhance the validity of the assessment. The reduction in item count is not merely quantitative; it alters the qualitative demands of the test. With 40 items to be completed in 60 minutes, the assessment now privileges "Reasoning" and "Application" cognitive levels over simple "Knowledge" recall.

Increased prominence requiring a broader bank of practice items.

The "Knowledge, Application, Reasoning, and Synthesis" (KARS) model drives the cognitive complexity of the new specifications.1 For Data Analysis, this means items must move beyond asking candidates to calculate a mean (Knowledge) to asking them to determine how an outlier affects the mean versus the median (Reasoning).
1.2 The Scope of Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability
The syllabus for Data Analysis in the EST II Math Level 1 is distinct from Level 2. It serves as a foundational assessment of statistical thinking. A critical finding from the 2026 Description Document is the explicit removal of conditional probability and complex geometric probability from Level 1, reserving these for Level 2.1
1.2.1 Core Content Domains
The domain is subdivided into four critical pillars:
Descriptive Statistics: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (range, standard deviation, variance). The focus is on the properties of these measures rather than manual calculation, given the calculator policy.
Data Representation: Interpretation of histograms, box-and-whisker plots, scatterplots, frequency tables, and stem-and-leaf plots.
Bivariate Data Analysis: Linear least-squares regression, correlation coefficients ($r$), coefficients of determination ($r^2$), and the interpretation of slope and intercept in context.
Probability and Counting: Fundamental counting principle, permutations, combinations, and probability of independent/mutually exclusive events.
1.2.2 Excluded Topics for 2026
To ensure the practice items are perfectly aligned, content developers must rigorously exclude:
Conditional Probability: Questions asking for $P(A|B)$ are out of scope.1
Bayes' Theorem: Reserved for advanced statistics courses.
Non-Linear Regression: Exponential and quadratic regression models are moved to Level 2.
Logic: Formal logic questions (truth tables) are no longer part of this domain.2
Part II: Psychometric Guidelines for Item Construction
Creating high-fidelity practice items requires adherence to psychometric principles that ensure items are valid (measure what they intend to measure) and reliable (perform consistently).
2.1 The Anatomy of a High-Quality Item
An effective multiple-choice item consists of a stem, a key (correct answer), and distractors (incorrect options).
The Stem: For the 2026 format, stems should present a problem situation or "stimulus" (e.g., a graph, a dataset, or a real-world scenario). Stems should be positively phrased, avoiding "Which of the following is NOT..." unless necessary for testing a specific misconception.
The Key: Must be unambiguously correct. In statistics, where rounding can introduce ambiguity, phrasing such as "which is closest to" is essential.
The Distractors: These are the most critical component. Distractors must not be random numbers; they must represent common cognitive errors.
Error Type 1: Formula Confusion. Using the permutation formula instead of combination.
Error Type 2: Conceptual Misunderstanding. Identifying the mode instead of the median.
Error Type 3: Calculation Error. Forgetting to order data before finding the median.
2.2 Cognitive Load and Item Difficulty
The KAR model dictates the distribution of difficulty.
Knowledge (Recall): Low cognitive load. Example: "Identify the range of the dataset."
Application (Skill): Moderate cognitive load. Example: "Calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 7 with two dice."
Reasoning (Strategic Thinking): High cognitive load. Example: "If the largest value in a dataset is doubled, how does this affect the standard deviation compared to the interquartile range?"
2.3 Bias and Sensitivity Review
Items must be free from cultural, gender, or regional bias. Names used in word problems should reflect the diversity of the EST test-taking population (e.g., using names like Layla, Omar, Youssef alongside Jack and Emily).1 Contexts should be universally accessible (e.g., avoiding sports rules specific to one region).
Part III: Domain-Specific Item Specifications
3.1 Descriptive Statistics Specifications
Items in this sub-domain assess the student's ability to summarize data.
Focus: Students must understand the physical meaning of "center" and "spread."
Key Concept: The robustness of statistics. Students should know that the median is resistant to outliers while the mean is sensitive to them.
Instructional Directive: Create items that force students to choose the appropriate measure of center for a skewed dataset.
3.2 Data Representation Specifications
Focus: Reading and interpreting graphical data.
Key Concept: Converting between representations (e.g., extracting raw data from a histogram to calculate a mean).
Instructional Directive: Use Box-and-Whisker plots frequently, as identifying Quartile 1 (Q1), Median (Q2), and Quartile 3 (Q3) is a high-frequency exam skill.3
3.3 Regression and Bivariate Data Specifications
Focus: Modeling linear relationships.
Key Concept: Interpretation of parameters. The slope represents the rate of change; the y-intercept represents the initial value.
Instructional Directive: Avoid items asking for manual calculation of the regression line (calculators do this). Instead, ask students to interpret the slope: "For every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by...".4
3.4 Probability and Counting Specifications
Focus: Quantifying uncertainty and counting arrangements.
Key Concept: distinguishing between Permutations (order matters) and Combinations (order does not matter).
Instructional Directive: Use scenarios involving "at least one" to test the complement rule ($1 - P(\text{none})$).

Part V: Answer Key and Pedagogical Rationale
The answer key provided below serves not just to verify correctness but to illuminate the underlying pedagogical intent of each item. Understanding why a specific option is the correct key and why others are viable distractors is crucial for educators preparing students for the 2026 specifications.
Table 2: Answer Key & Rationale (Selected Items)
Q#
Key
Rationale and Common Misconceptions
1
B
Calculation: Sum of 5 numbers = $5 \times 12 = 60$. Remove 18: $60 - 18 = 42$. Remaining count is 4. New Mean = $42 / 4 = 10.5$.

Trap: Dividing by 5 instead of 4 (Result 8.4).
3
A
Logic: SD is 0 only if all numbers are identical. If SD=0, range must be 0.
31
A
Formula: Geometric Mean = $\sqrt{4 \times 16} = \sqrt{64} = 8$.

Trap: Calculating Arithmetic Mean (10).
82
A
Interpretation: Slope represents the rate of change. "Decreases by 3" corresponds to -3.
108
B
Theory: Extrapolation assumes the established trend continues, which is often false in real-world scenarios.
123
A
Concept: Permutations vs Combinations. "Order matters" is the defining feature of Permutations.
131
B
Counting: "MOM" has 3 letters with 2 Ms repeating. Formula: $3! / 2! = 6 / 2 = 3$.
182
A
Compound Probability: Draw 1 (2/10), Draw 2 (1/9). Multiply for "AND". $2/10 \times 1/9 = 2/90 = 1/45$.

Part VI: Strategic Recommendations for Educators
6.1 Shift from Procedure to Concept
The removal of complex calculation topics like standard deviation formulas (for hand calculation) and the increased time per question suggests that 2026 items will punish "plug-and-chug" strategies. Educators should prioritize:
Interpretation: Give students a calculated regression line and ask for a paragraph explaining what the numbers mean in the problem's context.
Error Analysis: Present incorrect solutions and ask students to identify the logic error (e.g., confusing mutually exclusive with independent events).
6.2 Calculator Fluency
While the test is not about calculation speed, calculator fluency is essential for handling large datasets in the Data Analysis section. Students must be proficient in:
List Editor: Entering data into lists (L1, L2) to generate 1-Variable Statistics (Mean, Median, Q1, Q3).
Regression Functions: Using LinReg(ax+b) to find $r$ and $r^2$ instantly.
6.3 The "Logic" Trap
Teachers must explicitly stop teaching truth tables and formal logic symbols ($\wedge, \vee, \sim$) for Level 1, as these have been removed to make space for deeper statistical reasoning.2
By adhering to this report's guidelines and utilizing the provided item bank, educators can ensure their students are not just prepared for the test, but proficient in the essential data literacy skills required for university success.
