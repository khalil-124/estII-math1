Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses 
of Radiation

Radiation includes alpha, beta, and gamma rays; X rays; 
and protons, neutrons, pions, and other particles.
All these forms of radiation are called ionizing radiation, 
because they ionize material that they go through.
This ionization can cause damage to materials, including 
biological tissue.

31-5 Measurement of Radiation—Dosimetry
Radiation damages biological tissue, but it can also be used to treat cancer and 
other diseases.
It is important to be able to measure the amount, or dose, of radiation received. 
The source activity is the number of disintegrations per second, often measured 
in curies, Ci.
1 Ci = 3.70 × 1010 disintegrations per second
The SI unit for source activity is the becquerel (Bq):
1 Bq = 1 disintegration/s

Another measurement is the absorbed dose—the effect 
the radiation has on the absorbing material.
The rad, a unit of dosage, is the amount of radiation that 
deposits energy at a rate of 1.00 × 10−2 J/kg in any 
material.
The SI unit for dose is the gray, Gy:
1 Gy = 1 J/kg = 100 rad

The effect on tissue of 
different types of 
radiation varies, alpha 
rays being the most 
damaging. To get the 
effective dose, the dose is 
multiplied by the relative 
biological effectiveness.
31-5 Measurement of Radiation—Dosimetry
If the dose is measured in rad, the effective dose is
in rem; if the dose is grays, the effective dose is in
sieverts, Sv.
Natural background radiation is about 0.3 rem per year. 
The maximum for radiation workers is 5 rem in any one 
year, and below 2 rem per year averaged over 5 years.
A short dose of 1000 rem is almost always fatal; a short 
dose of 400 rem has about a 50% fatality rate.

31-6 Radiation Therapy
© 2016 Pearson Education, Ltd.
Cancer is sometimes treated 
with radiation therapy to 
destroy the cells. In order to 
minimize the damage to 
healthy tissue, the radiation 
source is often rotated so
it goes through different
parts of the body on
its way to the tumor.
Radioactive tracers can also be detected using 
tomographic techniques, where a three-dimensional 
image is gradually built up through successive scans.

31-9 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
© 2016 Pearson Education, Ltd.
The object to be examined is placed in a static magnetic 
field, and radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation 
is applied.
