30-1 Structure and Properties of the Nucleus
Nucleus is made of protons and neutrons
Proton has positive charge; here is its mass:
mp = 1.67262 × 10−27 kg
Neutron is electrically neutral, and slightly more massive 
than the proton:
mn = 1.67493 × 10−27 kg

30-1 Structure and Properties of the Nucleus
Neutrons and protons are collectively called nucleons.
The different nuclei are referred to as nuclides.
Number of protons: atomic number, Z
Number of nucleons: atomic mass number, A
Neutron number: N = A − Z

A and Z are sufficient to specify a nuclide. Nuclides are 
symbolized as follows:
X is the chemical symbol for the element; it contains the 
same information as Z but in a more easily recognizable 
form.

Nuclei with the same Z—so they are the same element—
but different N are called isotopes. 
For many elements, several different isotopes exist
in nature. 
Natural abundance is the percentage of a particular 
element that consists of a particular isotope in nature.

30-1 Structure and Properties of the Nucleus
Because of wave-particle duality, the size of the nucleus is somewhat fuzzy.

30-1 Structure and Properties of the Nucleus
Masses of atoms are measured with reference to the 
carbon-12 atom, which is assigned a mass of exactly 
12u. A u is a unified atomic mass unit.
1 u = 1.6605 × 10−27 kg = 931.5 MeV/c2

From the following table, you can see that the electron is 
considerably less massive than a nucleon.

30-3 Radioactivity
Towards the end of the 19th century, minerals were found 
that would darken a photographic plate even in the 
absence of light.
This phenomenon is now called radioactivity. 
Marie and Pierre Curie isolated two new elements that 
were highly radioactive; they are now called polonium 
and radium.

30-3 Radioactivity
Radioactive rays were observed to be of three types:
1. Alpha rays, which could barely penetrate a piece of 
paper
2. Beta rays, which could penetrate 3 mm of aluminum
3. Gamma rays, which could penetrate several 
centimeters of lead
We now know that alpha rays are helium nuclei, beta 
rays are electrons, and gamma rays are electromagnetic 
radiation.

30-8 Half-Life and Rate of Decay
Nuclear decay is a random process; the decay of any 
nucleus is not influenced by the decay of any other.

30-8 Half-Life and Rate of Decay
Therefore, the number of decays in a short time interval 
is proportional to the number of nuclei present and to
the time:
Here, λ is a constant characteristic of that particular 
nuclide, called the decay constant.

This equation can be solved, using calculus, for N as a 
function of time:

30-8 Half-Life and Rate of Decay
The half-life is the time it takes for half the nuclei in a 
given sample to decay. It is related to the decay constant:

Activity 
• The number of decays per second, or decay rate R, is the magnitude of and 
is also called the activity of the sample.

The unit of  activity is the number of disintegrations per second, often measured 
in curies, Ci.
1 Ci = 3.70 × 1010 disintegrations per second
The SI unit for source activity is the becquerel (Bq):
1 Bq = 1 disintegration/s

30-11 Radioactive Dating
© 2016 Pearson Education, Ltd.
Radioactive dating can be done by analyzing the fraction 
of carbon in organic material that is carbon-14.
The ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the atmosphere 
has been roughly constant over thousands of years. A 
living plant or tree will be constantly exchanging carbon 
with the atmosphere, and will have the same carbon ratio 
in its tissues.
30-11 Radioactive Dating

When the plant dies, this exchange stops. Carbon-14 has 
a half-life of about 5730 years; it gradually decays away 
and becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of the total 
carbon in the plant tissue.
This fraction can be measured, and the age of the
tissue deduced. 
Objects older than about 60,000 years cannot be dated 
this way—there is too little carbon-14 left.

Other isotopes are useful for geologic time scale dating.
Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.5 × 109 years, and has 
been used to date the oldest rocks on Earth as about
4 billion years old.
